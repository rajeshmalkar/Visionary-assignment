                                    I have really learnt a lot in these many years.Span was a great experience for me! All teachers and staff are very kind, 
                                    helpful and friendly and mainly, the studies here are a high point! The time when I came in this school was little difficult 
                                    to manage things because I hardly knew the basic English and I wasn't a bright student in academics ,but later gradually 
                                    I learnt speaking English confidently and all the time my class teacher and principal ma'am taught me where I was wrong and 
                                    I improved in my studies considerably. Overall Span school is one of the best school I have ever attended.

                                and now I am in grade 9!!! I found it so easy to make new friends when I first came to Span International
                                 Academy, students and teachers both made me feel so welcome. I have learned valuable leadership skills 
                                 while learning at my own pace. Span International Academy integrates compassion into its teaching standards,
                                  emphasizes the importance of values, and builds leaders through each of its classes and lessons. 
                                  When I arrived at SIA, my English ability was extremely limited. I found it very difficult to understand 
                                  what was going on in lessons. However, with English lessons and encouragement from both teachers and other
                                   students, I persevered and saw dramatic improvements. Though it was a small school, now turned into a huge
                                    campus, it allows the student-to-teacher ratio, giving us more confidence when asking questions, engaging
                                     in group activities, and opportunities for one-on-one time with the teachers. The teachers are constantly encouraging me
                                      to do my best. It is great knowing that they are there to help me reach my full potential. Our teachers are passionate
                                       about seeing their students succeed; they are so great about sharing moments of pride they see within us.
                                        A school with a Good Islamic education and a challenging IGCSE curriculum! GREAT TEAM - GREAT SCHOOL!!</p>

                  <p>Mornings at SIA are very harmonious and melodious, and why shouldn't they be so? Our children and staff look forward to coming to school.
                    As I go round the school every day, I hear the chatter of eager minds permeating the atmosphere at SIA. Gone are the days when the principal would look for the famous 'pin drop silence'. I look forward to cheerful greetings, endearing smiles, intelligent conversations and ethical behaviour. Yes! We are a school with a difference. We value individualism.</p>
